gpslog v0.1 - (C)2007 Dustin Spicuzza
==================================================================

The latest version of gpslog can be obtained from 

http://www.virtualroadside.com/gpslog/

This is a simple program I wrote to log GPS data retrieved from
GPSD into a mysql database. It is designed to be standalone and 
*just work*. I wrote the program because I have not been able to 
find a logging program that was standalone and could be running
continuously. There are a number of 
programs I am aware of that have GPS logging capabilities:

	- Kismet
	- GPSDrive


Installation
=============

This is your typical autotools-based install... 

./configure
make
make install


Usage
======
